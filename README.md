# Led_distance-Indicator
I have made a simple LED distance indicator using Arduino uno microcontroller
## How it works
The basic working of this experiment is that when an object is placed infront of the ultrasonic sensor the arduino is coded in such a way that an LED turns ON.
When an object is placed infront of the ultrasonic sensor, it calculates the distance between the sensor and the object and then turns ON the LED's. In this experiment a set of 5 LEDs are used which are programmed to turn ON at certain distances.
